Q1: What is the difference between EBS and S3?EBS provides block level storage to EC2 instances. The EBS volumes can be attached to an EC2 instance to provide extra storage or root volume storage. They are typically formatted with a file system and can persist past the life of the instance. They are similar to attaching hard drives to a computer and you pay for the amount of storage specified when creating the EBS volume.S3 provides object storage which is usually a file and its meta data. These objects are stored in buckets. S3 can hold any size files up to 5 terabytes and you are charged only for the amount of storage you use. S3 can be used on its own without an instance and can be interacted with via an API or the web console. It's designed for high availability, reliability and has unlimited capacity.Q2: When would you consider a cloud infrastructure for your data science tasks?When the data no longer fits on a laptop or if the processing of the data could be done significantly faster with more cores/memory then it might be a good idea to consider using cloud infrastructure. If you need collaborate with other people, then it might also be a good idea to consider cloud servers that everyone can access remotely.Q3: What is the difference between spot instances and reserved instances?With a spot instance you can bid on spare EC2 which can reduce the costs of running an instance significantly. However, if someone out bids you while you are using it the server will be terminated.Reserved instances allow you to purchase EC2 for 1 year or 3 years at significantly reduced pricing compared to on demand. This would be a good option if you know you need the server for a year or more.Q4: List the names of four software packages installed on the UCB AMIPython 2.6.6postgres (PostgreSQL) 8.4.20java version "1.7.0_79"perl, v5.10.1 (*) built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi
